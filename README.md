#Did You Know?

In Thracia 776, if one tries to give a unit both the Wrath and the Vantage skill, only Vantage will trigger.

##What are these skills?

Vantage, for starters, allows the player to always attack first in battle, even when the enemy initiates the battle. Wrath, on the other hand, allows the user to always score critical hits when the enemy initiates battle. Many players will be allured to this combination of skills assuming it will create a beast that will destroy everything on enemy phase by destroying any enemy they face before that enemy even gets to attack them. This mindset will especially linger in the minds of Genealogy of the Holy War players, who through proper planning and successful eugenics could successfully pull off this skill combination and watch their genetically sculpted child soldier wreak havoc.

##So why doesn't it work here?


Well, for one, in Thracia, Wrath only triggers if the unit is engaged by the enemy, same as Vantage. However, since Vantage has priority, it changes the state of the battle so that it's no longer the player counterattacking, but the enemy, making Wrath impossible to trigger.

A possible explanation for why this is, aside from an accident, is that the game developers saw how broken the combo was in Genealogy and made sure that units wouldn't be able to be nearly as broken in this game. Then again, those same people added the Beo Sword, which grants the user both skills as if they're supposed to work in tandem, so who're the real clowns here?
